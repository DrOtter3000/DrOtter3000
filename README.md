# Welcome to DrOtter3000's GitHub!

## About Me

Hello! I’m DrOtter3000, an indie game developer with a passion for open-source projects. Based in Berlin, Germany, I focus on creating unique, Linux-friendly games with Godot and an otter’s creative touch. I’m currently working on "Otter Survivor," a Vampire Survivors-inspired game that challenges players with endless waves of enemies, power-ups, and, of course—otters.

- **Based in:** Berlin, Germany
- **Open to collaborations on:** Open-source games in Godot
- **Always learning:** Spriting, 3D graphics, and Godot game development

## Featured Projects

Here’s a look at some of my favorite projects:

1. **Janitory Activity** (Parts [1](https://github.com/DrOtter3000/janitory-activity) & [2](https://github.com/DrOtter3000/janitory-activity-2)): A horror/walking simulator created for the WhiskeyDing0 Halloween Game Jams in 2023 and 2024.
   - There’s also a **Fluffy Edition**—a version of the original game without any horror elements, created specifically for Max Fluffy. *It is a version of the original game without horror elements.*
2. **[Sentinel](https://github.com/DrOtter3000/sentinel)**: A shooter/tower defense hybrid created for the Linux Deutschland Gamejam 2024 with the theme "unbeweglich" (immovable).
3. **[Die Hennerin](https://github.com/DrOtter3000/diehennerin)**: A skill-based game inspired by "dodge the creeps," where you play as Zaza the dog, collecting carrots while avoiding pineapples.

All my games are available on my [itch.io page](https://drotter3000.itch.io/).

## Fun Facts

- I develop and test all my games on Linux. If you encounter Windows-specific issues, it may be tough for me to troubleshoot—but since they’re open-source, you’re welcome to dive into the code and fix things as you like!
- My code might not be perfect, but for an otter, it’s surprisingly decent.
